              Hi, I'm Ross
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm an Edinburgh based Software Developer and recent graduate of
              CodeClan.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have a passion for design, creativity, and programming. With an
              eagerness to learn and work within the tech industry, I am
              constantly testing and playing with new technologies to improve
              myself as a developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time, I love to play my guitar and create music. I
              thrive on communication and collaboration, although I work equally
              well on my own. I also have a love for the band Pinegrove. Check
              them out on Spotify
